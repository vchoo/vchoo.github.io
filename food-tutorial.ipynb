    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Food pairing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodpairing) is a principle for deciding which foods, when eaten together, are better flavor-wise. [One study, *Flavor network and the principles of food\n",
    "pairing* published in *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00196), found that Western cooking, for example, prefers to pair foods when they share many flavors, as opposed to Eastern cooking, which tends to pair foods when they contrast flavor-wise. When combined with knowledge of what foods are central to each culture, it then becomes possible to derive insights what gives each cuisine its style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothetically, a [fusion restuarant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_cuisine) might choose to cook in a distinctly Eastern style (contrasting flavors) using mostly Western ingredients. It might even be possible to generate new cuisine styles that are designed to be as different as possible from existing styles. However, before any of that happens, we'll need data on food, and lots of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll need a database of flavor compounds in each kind of food ingredient. Several databases concerning food exist, such as [FoodDB](http://foodb.ca/), [FlavorNet](http://www.flavornet.org/), and [FlavorDB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29059383), but not all associate foods with the compounds they contain. The one at FlavorDB does, so we can scrape our data from the FlavorDB [website](https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/flavordb/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the data, we'll need it in a form that we can easily manipulate. [``Pandas DataFrames``](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) are a good choice - they're effectively small databases that we can access and manipulate with the power of Python's other libraries, and without the need for a SQL-like syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we'll be able to run all sorts of nice data visualizations and analysis methods on our ``DataFrames``."

    "# Acquiring Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first - how do we go about scraping the data from FlavorDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps to data scraping are:\n",
    "1. **Download** the JSON files which describe the chemical makeup of the food.\n",
    "    - Find the URLs which have the JSON files.\n",
    "    - Iterate over the URLs that have these JSON files, and download the data in them.\n",
    "2. **Process** the JSON data by converting it into a Pandas ``Dataframe``.\n",
    "3. **Clean** the ``DataFrame``.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps 1-2: JSON Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick inspection of the FlavorDB website reveals that all of the JSON files we want are at https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/flavordb/entities_json?id=x, where ``x`` is an integer. Then it's a cinch to write a few functions which go to those addresses and converts those JSON files into dictionaries. "
